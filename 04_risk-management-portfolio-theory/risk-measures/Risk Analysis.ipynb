    "## Sources of Financial Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business Risk from unforseen changes in orverall economic conditions\n",
    "* Estimatiuon risk from necessity fo long-term cash flow projections for decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "* Due to these factors, future cash flows may be different from expected cash flows used to make fincnaial decisiona. Variability in future outcomes of cbuseiness decision can be very different from extected outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk due to Several Factors\n",
    "* Shift in demand patterns and compeitions from other companies\n",
    "  - can reduce a company's sales revenue\n",
    "  - company may not be able to meet revenuse/costs forecasts\n",
    "* Unanticipated changes in production costs can efefcr cost estimates\n",
    "  - Changes in market conditions for the new raw materials\n",
    "  Rise in labor costs due to wage negotiations or other events\n",
    "  - Unavailability of a certain factor of produc\\tion due to unforseen events such as labor strikes\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The combined impact of these facots is that the margin on the sale of good planned by a company may be adversely affected\n",
    "    - Downard pressures on sellin prices may reduce cash inflows\n",
    "    - Upward pressures on factors of production may be increaseing cash outflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Financial Risk\n",
    "  * Financial Risk: The variab ility of future cash flows of a project\n",
    "    - To estimate it we use measures of variability in stats\n",
    "    - We have risk both when future cash flows are higher than or lower than expected\n",
    "      - Higher than expected sales can cause lost sales since production may be less than the demand for the product\n",
    "      - Lower than expected sales cans cause excess inventory since all product may not be sold, resulting in lower prices or obsolecense\n",
    "\n",
    "      <br>\n",
    "      <br>\n",
    "  * Example: Let us consider two projects, A and B\n",
    "    - x axis is future cash flow and y axis is probability\n",
    "    - project A has a steeper and narrower parabola, and project B has a wider and less steep parabola\n",
    "    - the Cash flow expected value is in the peak of the two parabolas, which is at the same x value\n",
    "    - Wider range of possible outcomes of cashflow next year is riskier, meaning B is riskier than A, even if both projects provide the same expected cash flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk-Return Tradeoff\n",
    "#### Howa re the rates of teturn we recieve from A and B related, given that they provide the same expected return?\n",
    "* Investors are typicallt risk-averse and prefer high returns with low risk\n",
    "* Each investor has different level of risk-aversion so it can be possible that B have a greater cashflow in certain conditions\n",
    "* Investors performa arbitrafe among risky projects which ensures that higher risk ensures higher returns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk-Return Arbitrage\n",
    "* Suppose A and B provide the same returm what will investors do?\n",
    "  - Arbitrage by simultaneously selling B and buying A (same return but with lower risk)\n",
    "  - Since investors are selling B, the price will fall; and since they are buying A, the price will increase\n",
    "  - As more people buy A, the price will go up, and a higher price means lower return, and as more people sell B, the price falls which means a higher return\n",
    "  - So, lower risk project A will provide lower return and higher risk project B will provide higher return\n",
    "  - Equilibrium prices setttles when the investors believe that the rates of return from A and B are commensurate with their riskiness. In the end the safter project offers a lower return and riskier project offers a higher return\n",
    "* Risk-Return arbitrage ensures higher risk projects provide higher expected returns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk- Return Tradeoff\n",
    "* x axis is project risk and y axis is expected project return\n",
    "* There is a linear slope upwars with A at a lower point than B\n",
    "* the slow of the line shows degree of th risk-aversion for one person\n",
    "* Above the line, expected return compensates for the project risk\n",
    "* Below the line, expected return does not compensate for the project risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Aversion and Risk-Return Trade-off\n",
    "* Individual X is more risk averse than Y and requires higher returns for the same risk than Y. So, more risk averse individuals require higher risk premium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project or Stand-Alone Risk\n",
    "* Risk: variability of future possible returns\n",
    "* Stand-alon or project risk: risk from investing in a single asset\n",
    "* Statistical techniques that measure variability are used to estimate risk\n",
    "  - We combine two measures:\n",
    "    - Expected value, and\n",
    "    - Standard deviation\n",
    "  - We will use discrete variables for simplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Project Risk\n",
    "* Cash outflow in the furure depend onf the state of the economy\n",
    "* Lets define the following:\n",
    "  - $ X_i $ as a random variable where $i$ represents the state of the economy (e.g. recession or booming), and\n",
    "  - $ P_i $ as the probability of state i occuring\n",
    "* Expected value of the outcome is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "% Expected Value\n",
    "E(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \\, X_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  - where $n$ is the number of states possible\n",
    "* The variance of cashflows is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "% Variance\n",
    "\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \\,\\bigl(X_i - E(X)\\bigr)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standard deviation is the square-root of the variance\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_X = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}\n",
    "          = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \\bigl(X_i - E(X)\\bigr)^2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  - Measures the dispersion of cash flows; high dispersion means that possible cash flows are widely distributed meaning higher risk\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Where only four outcomes are possible, we get:\n",
    "  - $ \\E(X) = P_1 X_1 + P_2 X_2 + P_3 X_3 + P_4 X_4 $\n",
