    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Common Stock Par Value** : Face value of the stock, and usually has no relation to the market value. Some companies have shares with 0 par value, so a stock in the market can sell for $100 a share and have par value of 0 in the copmany books\n",
    "- **Dividend**: Payment by a company to the shareholdes that represents a return on cpital provided by the shareholder to the company.\n",
    "- **Market Value**: Each share of stock is entitled to one vote to elect director at annual meeting of the company.\n",
    "    - \"In straight voting, one vote per share is cast for each director up for election.\n",
    "    - In cumulative voting, all the votes available to each shareholder (depending on the number of directors up for election) can be cast for only one director (rather than one for each director).\n",
    "    - For example, if you own 100 shares of a company and the company is electing 3 directors, you have 300 votes. In straight voting you can cash 100 votes for each director. In cumulative voting you can cash all 300 votes for one director.\" (Yash R. Puri, Stock Valuation)\n",
    "- **Preemptive Right**: If a company issues new shares, the existing shareholders have a right to purchase the new shares in proprotion to what they hold.\n",
    "    - \"For example, if you own 5% of a companyâ€™s shares, and the company decides to issue 1,000 new shares to raise new capital, preemptive right will give you the right to purchase 50 new shares issued by the company.\" (Yash R. Puri, Stock Valuation)"

    "## Valuation Principle\n",
    "- Value of a security is based on the cash flows provided by the security to the purchaser\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonds v. Stocks\n",
    "- Bond valuation relatively easy as cash flows are known at the time of purchase\n",
    "    - Interest payment during the life of the bond, and\n",
    "    - repayment of the face value at maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stock valuation is harder since cash flows from stocks to the investor are not certain\n",
    "    - Dividends are not guarantee; nor do they remain fixed\n",
    "    - The investment is forever, and the company is not required to pay back the investment at any time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Stock Valuation Model\n",
    "- Simple assumptions to estimate future cash flows, and\n",
    "    - calculate their present value to arrive at stock value\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will use the following terminology:\n",
    "    - **$P_t$**: **Market Price** per share at the end of time period $t$\n",
    "    - **$D_t$**: **Dividend** per share at the end of pr\\period $t$, where\n",
    "    - **$t$**: the time period (0, 1, 2, etc.)\n",
    "    - **$R$**: **Market required rate of return** for investment in this risk class\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "#### Simple Cash Flow Assumptions\n",
    "- You plan to buy a share of stock today, and you know what the stock:\n",
    "    - will pay a dividend of $5 a year from now, and\n",
    "    - will be worth $85 at that time\n",
    "- Assume you require 10% rate of return from such stock, how much is the stock worth to you today?\n",
    "    - Note: Real life, we don't know these values. These assumptions are for arriving to a methodology for valuing stocks\n",

    "    - $P_0$ = ?\n",
